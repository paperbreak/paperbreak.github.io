You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a famous equation: $E = mc^2$ as an inline example.

The quadratic formula is an important equation in mathematics:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

The Euler identity is considered one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics:

$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$

And here's a more complex example with matrices:

$$ \begin{bmatrix} 
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_1 \\
b_2 \\
b_3
\end{bmatrix} $$
